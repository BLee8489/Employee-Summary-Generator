# Employee-Summary-Generator

INSTRUCTIONS:
You will build an employee team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

USER STORY:
As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info, so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

INSTALLATION:
Must install Inquirer in Node using npm i inquirer.

USAGE:
Node, Inquirer, and JavaScript.

TESTS:
Run "npm run test" to make sure all functions run properly and pass the test.
